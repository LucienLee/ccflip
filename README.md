# ccflip

Multi-account switcher for Claude Code.

ccflip swaps authentication credentials between Claude Code accounts. Your skills, settings, themes, `CLAUDE.md`, MCP servers, keybindings, and all other configuration stay exactly the same. One shared environment, multiple accounts.

Say you have a personal Claude Max account and a work account with API access. ccflip lets you flip between them while keeping your carefully set up Claude Code config intact.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Credential Storage |
|---|---|
| macOS | System Keychain |
| Linux | `secret-tool` keyring (preferred), file-based fallback (owner-only access) |
| WSL | Same as Linux |
| Windows | Not yet supported |

## Install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then:

```bash
bun install -g ccflip
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add your first account (must be logged into Claude Code)
ccflip add --alias personal

# Log out, log into second account, add it too
ccflip add --alias work

# Switch accounts interactively
ccflip

# Switch by alias
ccflip work
ccflip personal

# Rotate to next account
ccflip next
```

After switching, restart Claude Code to pick up the new authentication.
